        "## Data Transformation\n\nThe T5 model does not work with raw text. Instead, it requires the text to be transformed into numerical form\nin order to perform training and inference. The following transformations are required for the T5 model:\n\n1. Tokenize text\n2. Convert tokens into (integer) IDs\n3. Truncate the sequences to a specified maximum length\n4. Add end-of-sequence (EOS) and padding token IDs\n\nT5 uses a SentencePiece model for text tokenization. Below, we use a pre-trained SentencePiece model to build\nthe text pre-processing pipeline using torchtext's T5Transform. Note that the transform supports both\nbatched and non-batched text input (i.e. one can either pass a single sentence or a list of sentences), however\nthe T5 model expects the input to be batched.\n\n\n"
